# Goal Tracker App
> This App is a part of the Troopl's challenge to build a web app to keep track of uour goals- This could also be like a to-do list app

```
    Rails for backend
    React for frontend
```

## The Origin [Troopl's Challenge](https://troopl.com/challenges/goal-tracking-app)
> Let's start 2022 with a bang by building your very own goal tracking app 🥳


Use any language/framework to build a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) web app that lets people:

Create an account
Add a goal 
Update a goal as complete (i.e. a percentage or true/false) 
Visualise complete and incomplete goals 
Delete a goal


You may add any additional functionality and put your own creative spin on the challenge (if you like) 🦄



We encourage you to build a goal tracking app that you will actually use to track personal goals, hobbies, or activities. So what your app tracks is completely up to you!  



A few thought starters: 

Fitness goals 🏃‍♀️
Books to read 📚
Travel destinations (we're feeling optimistic 😎)
Movie watch list 🍿
Birds you've spotted 🐓
Beer brands consumed 🍺
Open goal tracker that tracks anything! ⚡️
